# crypto_AI_learning_M10


This is a Jupyter Notebook that clusters crypto currencies by clusters

---

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/google/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python
* [KMeans](https://github.com/google/KMeans) - The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset
* [PCA](https://github.com/google/pca) - PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space.
* [StandardScaler](https://github.com/google/StandardScaler) - Provides several common utility functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.
